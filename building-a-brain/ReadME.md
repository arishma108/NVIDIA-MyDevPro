Creating a script to simulate a brain is a complex task, but we can start by building a basic neural network, which is a simplified model inspired by the human brain. 

This script creates a simple neural network with three layers. The first two layers have 64 neurons each and use the ReLU activation function, while the final layer has 10 neurons and uses the softmax activation function, which is typically used for classification tasks.
